# BookReviewApp
This is my BookReviewApp that I'm currently working on.
It is a **Rest API** for a book-review website.
Right now it is just a CRUD application Rest API, but I am still developing it. 
In the nearby future I am planning to add some other features including ability to send an email (as a newsletter),
***secure*** user authentication system, and perhaps some Thymeleaf Template Views.
## Already implemented features:
- 2 application profiles - dev(database in mysql) & prod(h2 database with synthetic data)
- 2 entity classes with relation OneToMany (one author can posses many books)
- CRUD actions
- DTO/DAO & MVC patterns
